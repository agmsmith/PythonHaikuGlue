Check out the latest sources from SVN::

Reading Guidelines
====================
All of the functions have ``__doc__`` strings for your viewing pleasure.
Very handy if you're using this interactively.

Modules are often named the same as the kit's name in lower-case characters, e.g. the Storage Kit is named ``beos.storage``.
